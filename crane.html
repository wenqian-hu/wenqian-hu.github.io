                                        areas, while 70 million were left-behind in predominantly rural areas (UNICEF 2014)."(Yu and Luo, 307) </p>

                                        children are restricted. With such a large group of left-behind children being apart with their parents in a long term, a solution to facilitate the communication between left-behind children and their parents is
                                        urgently needed.</p>

                                    In a featured news story, a left-behind child named Liu Ling folds paper cranes everyday, because she believes that when she folds 1000 paper cranes, her dad will come back home. The paper crane is also a symbol of beautiful hopes and good wishes, representing
                                    that both children and parents want each other to be happy and safe everyday even though they are far away. A lot of people also write down their wishes on the back of a paper before folding it into a crane.

                                <p>I created the first version of the UI design during the Hackathan back to 2017 when I knew little about design. The major critiques I recieved include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>The key feature is not prominent (it used to include chatting and reading functions)</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>outdated UI</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>I updated this project as a design challenge to myself. The renovation began with substraction:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                      <p>Chop down the distracting functions and only focus on one user flow</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      <p>Restart from low-fidelity and concentrate on visual hierarchy</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
