                                        “In contemporary China, rural-to-urban migration has affected the lives of a significant proportion of China’s children. Among the estimated 106 million children impacted by migration in 2010, 35.81 million children migrated with their parents to urban
                                        areas, while 70 million were left-behind in predominantly rural areas (UNICEF 2014)."(Yu and Luo, 307) Due to Chinese Hukou (户口) system, the mobility of these children are restricted. With such a large group of left-behind
                                        children being apart with their parents in a long term, a solution to facilitate the communication between left-behind children and their parents is urgently needed.

                                    In a featured news story, a left-behind child named Liu Ling folds paper cranes everyday, because she believes that when she folds 1000 paper cranes, her dad will come back home. The paper crane is also a symbol of beautiful hopes and good wishes, representing
                                    that both children and parents want each other to be happy and safe everyday even though they are far away. A lot of people also write down their wishes on the back of a paper before folding it into a crane.

                                <p>1) In order to guide parents and children to have <i>quality communication</i>, we chose the format of <i>handwritten</i> cards that can attach <i>photos</i>, <i>audios</i> and <i>videos</i>
                                    to it. Cards are careful collections of love that can be stored digitally or be printed out and saved physically, while text message are more scattered and lack a sense of ritual.</p>
                                <p>2) To target our specific users, we provide <i>suggested topics</i> that encourage both to talk about in the chatting section. In our research, we foun that a lot of parents <i>do not know how to show their love and concern</i>
                                    to their kids, and the <i>scope of their communication topics is very limited</i>. They always end up asking the same questions, such as “how’s the weather today” or “did you behave well at school”. Their
                                    ineffective way of communication gradually causes the relationship to become <i>"frozen"</i> between their kids in the end. </p>
                                <p>3) Educating the parents with <i>parenting methods</i> is also essential. A lot of migrant parents <i>rely on school teachers and grandparents</i> to educate their kids, which results in the
                                    lack of family education for the kids. Our app includes an education section for parents and will push articles to them daily, <i>teaching what they should teach their kids and the techniques of effective communication</i>.
                                    It is good to mention some topics like “reading bedtime stories” to the parents and they will figure out a way the achieve that somehow remotely. It makes parents <i>more qualified parents</i> and help them take
                                    in actions than simply giving their kids money. </p>
